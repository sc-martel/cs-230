CS 230 Operating Platforms System Design Documentation


# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you  to design?
The client is "The Gaming Room." They requested a web-based version of their Android game "Draw It or Lose It," which allows teams to compete in guessing drawn puzzles. The software should accommodate multiple teams and players, with unique naming checks and unique identifiers for games, teams, and players.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I clearly outlined the client's requirements, provided a structured approach for software development, and highlighted key features like ensuring uniqueness for game and team names and using unique identifiers for different instances.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the design document provided a clear roadmap and specifications for development. It helped in foreseeing potential challenges and ensuring that the end product would align with the client's expectations.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I might revisit the method of ensuring game and team name uniqueness. To improve it, I'd consider adding a faster, more efficient system for name verification or suggesting alternative names upon duplication.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by analyzing the game concept and the client's request for a web-based platform. Considering user needs is crucial because it ensures that the end product is user-friendly, fulfills its intended purpose, and meets the user's expectations, resulting in better adoption and user satisfaction.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached software design by first understanding the client's requirements, then outlining a structured plan addressing those needs. In the future, I'd employ user feedback, prototyping, and iterative design to analyze and create similar software applications.
